# Ultimate cyberd CLI guide. Testnet: Euler-4

## If something wrong...

  First of all I would like to encourage you to use  `--help` feature if you want to get better experience of using cyberdcli. This is really easy way to find all necessary commands with options and flags.

  For example you can enter:

  ```bash
  docker exec cyberd cyberdcli --help
  ```

  You should see this message:

  ```bash
  Command line interface for interacting with cyberd

  Usage:
    cyberdcli [command]

  Available Commands:
    status      Query remote node for status
    query       Querying subcommands
    tx          Transactions subcommands

    keys        Add or view local private keys

    rest-server Start LCD (light-client daemon), a local REST server

    version     Print the app version
    link        Create and sign a link tx
    help        Help about any command

  Flags:
        --chain-id string   Chain Id of cyberd node
    -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
    -h, --help              help for cyberdcli
        --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
    -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
        --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
  ```

  Help feature working as a stairs - you can use it with any command to find available options, subcommands and flags. For example lets explore `query` subcommands:

  ```bash
  docker exec cyberd cyberdcli query --help
  ```

  now, you can see subcommand structure:

  ```bash
  Usage:
  cyberdcli query [command]
  ```

  and available subcommands and flags:

  ```bash
  Available Commands:
  tendermint-validator-set Get the full tendermint validator set at given height
  block                    Get verified data for a the block at given height
  txs                      Search for all transactions that match the given tags.
  tx                       Matches this txhash over all committed blocks

  account                  Query account balance
  gov                      Querying commands for the governance module
  distr                    Querying commands for the distribution module
  staking                  Querying commands for the staking module
  slashing                 Querying commands for the slashing module

  Flags:
    -h, --help   help for query

  Global Flags:
        --chain-id string   Chain Id of cyberd node
    -e, --encoding string   Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default "hex")
        --home string       directory for config and data (default "/root/.cyberdcli")
    -o, --output string     Output format (text|json) (default "text")
        --trace             print out full stack trace on errors
  ```

  Alright, lets explore `account` subcommand:

  ```bash
  docker exec cyberd cyberdcli query account --help
  ```

  Now we see all options available at this subcommands, namely, account address and flags:

  ```bash
  Usage:
  cyberdcli query account [address] [flags]
  ```

  In most cases you need just two extra flags:

  ```bash
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --chain-id=<testnet_chain_id>
  ```

  That it. This is very useful ability for using cyberdcli and troubleshooting.

## Glossary

  **Bandwidth** - The recovered unit of your account. Used to complete transactions in the cyberd blockchain. The amount of your bandwidth calculates like:

  `your_cyb_tokens / all_cyb_tokens_in_cyberd * 2000*1000*100`.

  Messages cost is `500` (exclude link). Transaction consists of one or more messages `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. Transaction cost is `300 + c_1 + c_2 ... + c_n`, where `c_i` - cost of `m_i` message. Full bandwidth regeneration time is 86400 blocks (24 hours)

  **commission** -  tokens that you've earned with validation. You can take them at any time.

  **illiquid tokens** - non-transferable tokens that you've delegated to the validator. Delegation process duration - 1 block. **Unbonding** process, or taking back share - 3 weeks.

  **link** - reference between CID key and CID value. Link message cost is `100*n`, where `n` is quantity of links in message. Link finalization time is 1 block. New rank for CIDs of link will be recalculated at period from 100 to 200 blocks (from 100 to 200 seconds).

  **liquid tokens** - transferable tokens in cyberd blockchain

  **local keystore** - store with keys in you local machine

  **rewards** - tokens that you've earned with the delegation. To reduce network loads all rewards storing in a pool. You can take your part of bounty at any time by commands at **delegator** section.

  **<comission_rate_percentage>** - the commission that validator get for the work. Must be fraction >0 and <=1

  **<delegator_address>** - delegator address. Starts with `cyber` most often coinciding with **<key_address>**

  **<key_address>** - account address. Starts with `cyber`

  **<key_name>** - name of account in cybercli

  **<operator_address>** - validator address. Starts with `cybervaloper`

  **<shares_percentage>** - the part of illiquid tokens that you want to unbonding or redelegate. Must be fraction >0 and <=1

  **<testnet_chain_id>** - version of testnet.
